## Dependencies

### React

A JavaScript framework and library created by Facebook (Meta) thats used to build user interfaces quickly and with less code than vanilla JavaScript. Create reusable components to build your application following **DRY**. React aslo has a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to render web pages faster. React docs can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

### Sass

A CSS preprocesser that includes great features like variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance. Great for updating colors and themes quickly with variables, and for creating mixins for commonly used CSS, like centering elements within a container. Sass docs can be found [here](https://sass-lang.com/guide).

### React Router

React Router enables "client side routing". Client side routing allows your app to update the URL from a link click without making another request for another document from the server. This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for the next page. React router docs can be found [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

<!-- think this is not needed / refactor needed / results != [] then load result component -->

### React Icons

A great library for tons of icons that can easily be imported. Uses ES6 imports so you can import only the icons you need. Docs can be found [here](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

### React Scroll

A react library that provides tools to easily animate vertical scrolling. Docs can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll).

### Material UI
